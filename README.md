Power supply to run my modular synth.  The majority of the modules are run via Arduino Nano which I power via 9V's.  This rail allows me to connect a battery to the power rail to power all of the modules. I charge the battery via a USB C input and battery charging module.  To get the 9V's needed from the battery I run it through a voltage regulator (just a cheap one from Ali Express) to bring up the voltage to 9V.  Then the power is distributed via JST connectors along the rail. I have also included a voltage regulator on the rail to bring the voltage down to 5V's which can be used to also power other modules using 5V's.
